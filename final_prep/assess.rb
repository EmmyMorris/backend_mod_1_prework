def assess_situation(danger_level, save_the_day, bad_excuse)
# Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
#   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the bad_excuse to the terminal
#   - Anything danger_level that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the save_the_day string to the terminal
#   - If the danger_level is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the terminal.
