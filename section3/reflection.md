## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * A point from the growth mindset article that resonated with me was the skill of understanding that mistakes are essential to learning. I am a person who puts myself down are running into mistakes, so adopting this mindset will help me a lot. A point from the video that resonated with me was the thinking of the Growth Mindset. When you have a Growth Mindset you see yourself as yourself in that moment and you can change or become whatever you want to be.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by reflecting on the process of developing and figuring out what worked and what didn't. I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset right now because I don't feel my mistakes are critical to my learning. I need to realize that my mistakes help me learn and I don't need to be discouraged when I mess up.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  * A hash is a unordered collection of data where each element organized into key/value pairs. A hash is different from an array because they can hold data that are not only integers.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {fish: 600, cats: 20, mice: 12}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
    * You would access the value 'Iowa' with the command `.values[1]`
```
 states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`
p states.values[1]
 ```
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  * You can get all the keys with the command `.keys` and the values with `.values`.
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  * Another example of when we might use a hash is for a password verification. A hash could store the password data and store password verification answers. This works better as a hash rather than an array because there needs to be a key and a value.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * Nothing for now!
